# Playwright MCP Workshop Guide

> Read this guide before using the Playwright MCP server with GitHub Copilot in this repository.

This workshop is organized for hands-on delivery. It starts with setup, moves into quick validation, then walks through guided MCP exercises in a practical order.

---

## 1. Workshop Goal

By the end of this lab, participants should be able to:

- understand what Playwright MCP adds on top of normal Playwright test generation
- configure the Playwright MCP server in VS Code
- start the local application and verify the configured base URL
- use MCP browser tools to navigate, click, type, upload, drag, inspect, and validate UI behavior
- connect interactive MCP validation with the repo's normal Playwright test suite

---

## 2. What Is Playwright MCP?

The Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server exposes browser automation
capabilities to AI agents as callable tools. When configured in VS Code, the
`@playwright` can navigate pages, click elements, fill forms, take
screenshots, and evaluate JavaScript — all within the agent conversation.

This enables two modes of operation:

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Generate | Agent writes Playwright spec files. |
| Generate + Execute | Agent writes tests and can also validate behavior interactively against the running app. |

---

## 3. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | Version 18 or later |
| VS Code | Latest recommended |
| GitHub Copilot extension | Latest recommended |
| Playwright | Installed through this repo's dependencies |
| Running app | Must be reachable at the configured base URL |

### Install Node.js via nvm

Download and install nvm:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.4/install.sh | bash
```

Load nvm into the current shell (in lieu of restarting the terminal):

```bash
\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
```

Download and install Node.js:

```bash
nvm install 24
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
node -v   # Should print v24.14.1
npm -v    # Should print 11.11.0
npx -v    # Should print 11.11.0
```

### Install Chromium for Playwright

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

---

## 4. Installation

### Option A — Microsoft Playwright MCP (Recommended)

The official Microsoft Playwright MCP package is `@playwright/mcp`.

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/mcp
```

Verify installation:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp --version
```

### Option B — Community Playwright MCP Server

If using the `playwright-mcp` community package:

```bash
npm install -g playwright-mcp
```

---

## 5. Configuration - Verify VS Code picks it up

### Option A: Global MCP Server Configuration (Recommended)

1. Open Copilot Chat.
2. Type `@playwright`.
3. Open the tool picker or configure tools UI.
4. Confirm the Playwright browser tools are listed.

---

### Option B: Workspace-driven execution

Add the configuration `npx @playwright/mcp@latest` inside `.vscode/mcp.json`, if you want to use the local workspace config instead of global configuration.

### Step 1: Open MCP configuration

Open VS Code Settings → search for `MCP` → open `mcp.json`
(or create `.vscode/mcp.json` in the workspace root).

![alt text](/GuidedLab/images/vscode-mcp-json.png)

### Step 2: Add the server entry

#### Using `@playwright/mcp` (Microsoft package)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp", "--browser", "chromium"],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using `playwright-mcp` (community package)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["playwright-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Check Available Tool Names

When the MCP server is active, these are the browser tools expected in this workshop.

### Navigation tools

- `browser_navigate`: Navigate to a URL
- `browser_navigate_back`: Go back to the previous page in browser history
- `browser_resize`: Resize the browser window
- `browser_close`: Close the current page

### Interaction

- `browser_click`: Perform click on a web page element
- `browser_fill_form`: Fill multiple form fields
- `browser_type`: Type text into an editable element
- `browser_select_option`: Select an option in a dropdown
- `browser_handle_dialog`: Handle a browser alert, confirm, prompt, or file chooser dialog
- `browser_hover`: Hover over an element on the page
- `browser_press_key`: Press a keyboard key
- `browser_drag`: Perform drag and drop between two elements
- `browser_file_upload`: Upload one or more files

### Inspection

- `browser_snapshot`: Capture an accessibility-style snapshot of the current page
- `browser_take_screenshot`: Take a screenshot of the current page
- `browser_evaluate`: Evaluate JavaScript expression on page or element

- `browser_console_messages`: Return browser console messages
- `browser_network_requests`: Return network requests since loading the page

### Context tools

- `browser_tabs`: List, create, close, or select a browser tab

---

## 7. Selector Convention For This App [Optional]

Use existing `data-testid` values when possible. Do not use CSS classes or positional selectors for workshop demos.

Correct examples:

```json
{
  "tool": "browser_click",
  "selector": "[data-testid='profile-submit']"
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "browser_click",
  "selector": "data-testid=start-quiz"
}
```

Wrong examples:

```json
{
  "tool": "browser_click",
  "selector": ".btn-primary"
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "browser_click",
  "selector": "button:nth-child(2)"    // positional
}
```

Useful selectors already present in this app include:

- `profile-submit`
- `open-modal`
- `fact-topic`
- `load-fact`
- `drag-penguin`
- `drop-ice`
- `start-quiz`
- `next-question`

---

## 8. Start The Application

From the repository root, start the app with:

```bash
npm start
```

The app should be available at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Recommended first pages:

- `/playground`
- `/quiz`

Optional verification from a terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

Optional verification in a browser:

```bash
open http://localhost:3000/playground
open http://localhost:3000/quiz
```

### Playwright config (optional)  

The current base URL in `playwright.config.ts` is:

```ts
use: {
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  trace: 'on-first-retry'
}
```

If the app host or port changes, update both places.

## 12. Troubleshooting

### MCP server does not appear in Copilot

1. Check `.vscode/mcp.json` syntax.
2. Reload the VS Code window.
3. Open the Copilot or MCP output panel and inspect errors.
4. Run `npx @playwright/mcp --version` to confirm the package is available.

### Navigation fails immediately

- Confirm the app is running at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Open the same URL in a regular browser to separate app issues from MCP issues.
- Confirm the MCP base URL matches the Playwright base URL.

### An element is not found

- Confirm the element exists on the currently visible page.
- Prefer `data-testid` selectors already present in the app.
- Use `browser_snapshot` first if the UI state may have changed.
- Use `browser_take_screenshot` if you need a quick visual check.
